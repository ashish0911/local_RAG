# Local RAG System

This is a sample document for testing our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances large language models by providing them with relevant information retrieved from a knowledge base. This approach allows the model to generate more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.

Key components of a RAG system include:

1. **Document Processing**: Converting various document formats into text that can be processed.
2. **Text Chunking**: Breaking down documents into smaller, manageable pieces.
3. **Embedding Generation**: Creating vector representations of text chunks.
4. **Vector Storage**: Storing these embeddings in a vector database for efficient retrieval.
5. **Retrieval**: Finding the most relevant information based on a query.
6. **Generation**: Using the retrieved information to generate a response.

## Benefits of RAG

- Reduces hallucinations by grounding responses in factual information
- Enables access to domain-specific knowledge
- Allows for up-to-date information without retraining the model
- Improves transparency by citing sources

## Implementation with Langchain and Ollama

Our implementation uses:
- Langchain for orchestrating the RAG pipeline
- Ollama for running LLMs locally
- ChromaDB as a vector database
- Document loaders and text splitters from Langchain

This approach ensures privacy and data sovereignty while providing powerful AI capabilities.
